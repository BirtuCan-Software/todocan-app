# TodoCan App

## Overview:
TodoCan App is a simple cross-platform mobile application created as part of a tutorial to help users organize their tasks. The app utilizes a combination of Flutter with Riverpod for the client-side interface and Django for the server-side RESTful API.

## Technologies Used:
* Flutter: A popular framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. [Flutter Docs](https://flutter.dev/)
* Riverpod: A provider package for Flutter that makes it easy to work with state management. 
* Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. [Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/)
